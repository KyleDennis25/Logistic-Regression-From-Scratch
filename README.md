# Fitting a Logistic Regression Model From Scratch

In this project, I fit a logistic regression model from scratch using Python. To do so, I utilized a series of iterative algorithms to fit the model. This was done without relying on machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, which automate this process. The goal of this project is to better understand the underlying mathematics behind logistic regression model fitting.
