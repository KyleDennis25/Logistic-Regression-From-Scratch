# Fitting a Logistic Regression Model From Scratch

In this project, I fit a logistic regression model from scratch using Python. To do so, I utilized a series of iterative algorithms to fit the model. This was done without relying on machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, which automate this process. The goal of this project is to better understand the underlying mathematics behind logistic regression model fitting.

# File Descriptions
**Report.docx**- Comprehensive project report, which includes the mathematical background to the optimization procedure used throughout the project.

**functions.py**- Python file which contains functions used for model fitting.

**test_case**- Python test case file. This file uses functions from functions.py to manually fit a logistic regression model, from data import to parameter convergence.
